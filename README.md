# Leaflet

Leaflet consists of a Bayesian mixture model that identifies latent cell states (or cell types) related to underlying alternative splicing differences in junctions. 

## Compatibility with sequencing platforms 

- Smart-Seq2
- Split-Seq (ParseBio)

## Installation

Leaflet is a Python module which currently runs on Python version 3.9 or higher. Leaflet can be directly installed from github using the following command:

```pip install git+https://github.com/daklab/Leaflet.git``` 

This will automatically install any missing package dependencies.

Alternatively, Leaflet can be installed via conda:

```some code```

## Leaflet input
1. Run Leaflet's junction clustering function to obtain splicing event clusters for downstream analysis
2. Cell annotation file

## Getting started 

### Creating a Leaflet object with smart-seq2 data
