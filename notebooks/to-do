Follow a naming convention that shows the owner and the order the analysis was done in. 
We use the format <step>-<ghuser>-<description>.ipynb (e.g., 0.3-bull-visualize-distributions.ipynb).

Refactor the good parts. Don't write code to do the same task in multiple notebooks. 
If it's a data preprocessing task, put it in the pipeline at src/data/make_dataset.py and load data from data/interim. 
If it's useful utility code, refactor it to src.

# OPTIONAL: Load the "autoreload" extension so that code can change
%load_ext autoreload

# OPTIONAL: always reload modules so that as you change code in src, it gets loaded
%autoreload 2

from src.data import make_dataset
